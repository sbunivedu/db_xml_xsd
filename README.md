# XML Schema

An XML Schema describes the structure of an XML document. The XML Schema language is also referred to as XML Schema Definition (XSD). The purpose of an XML Schema is to define the legal building blocks of an XML document:
* the elements and attributes that can appear in a document
* the number of (and order of) child elements
* data types for elements and attributes
* default and fixed values for elements and attributes

This example demonstrates the use of XSD for XML data validation. The data can be found in [example.xml](example.xml) and two versions of XSD are in [example.xsd](example.xsd) and [example1.xsd](example1.xsd). You can use the following tool experiment with the XML and XSDs: https://www.xmlvalidation.com/
